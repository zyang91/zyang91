## üßë Introduction
Zhanchao Yang is a dual-degree master's student pursuing a Master of City Planning (MCP) and a Master of Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA) at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design. He also works as a graduate research assistant in transportation. His academic and research journey is driven by a strong commitment to advancing transportation planning and spatial analysis through cutting-edge geospatial technologies and data-driven approaches. With a deep interest in how cities function, Zhanchao focuses on integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and urban informatics techniques to address real-world problems in understanding travel behavior, smart mobility, and intelligent transportation systems. His work supports more equitable, efficient, and sustainable urban infrastructure. Zhanchao earned his bachelor's degree from Binghamton University, SUNY. In recognition of his academic excellence, research leadership, and civic engagement, he was honored with the 2024 SUNY Chancellor's Award for Student Excellence (CASE)‚Äîthe highest recognition for SUNY students.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Research Interests

My research interests involve leveraging advanced geospatial technologies to support a city and regional planning framework, as well as the smart cities initiative, particularly in the field of transportation. I focus on integrating spatial data science, transportation systems analysis, and remote sensing to address complex urban challenges. My work aims to inform equitable, data-driven, and future-oriented planning decisions.

### üåé GIS and Spatial Analytics
- Application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in urban and regional planning  
- Spatial modeling of human mobility and travel behavior 
- Use of open spatial data for decision support and policy analysis  

### üöé Transportation Planning and Analytics
- Multimodal transportation network analysis and planning  
- Travel behavior modeling, survey data analysis, and data mining  
- Interaction between transportation infrastructure and land use  
- Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and smart mobility technologies  
- Planning for active transportation and sustainable urban mobility  
- Equity and accessibility analysis in transportation planning  

### üåÜ Remote sensing and Raster Analytics
- Land cover classification and change detection  
- Machine learning and GeoAI for image classification and feature extraction  
- Spatial-temporal analysis
- UAV and high-resolution satellite imagery modeling and analysis
